# CloudWatch Examples

Using the [EBS Examples Repo](https://github.com/jwnichols3/ebs-examples/) as a starting point, this is a more structured version of the project. This concentrates on modular Python scripts to interact with CloudWatch. The structure of the EBS Examples repo is one of single-script examples. This project aims to be more reusable and modular.

The [Starting Points](./starting_points/) folder has single-script examples from the EBS Examples repo ported over for reference.
